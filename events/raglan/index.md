<h2>Ormþing needs you!</h2>

<p>Volunteering to help plan and run Ormþing — the big Summer camping event in Insulae Draconis — is a unique and exciting opportunity to support the Principality in one of its most popular pastimes. As a member of the planning committee or as an event volunteer, you will have the chance to work alongside a dedicated team of event organizers to bring the magic of the medieval era to life. Maybe even at a castle.</p>

<h3>Ormþing Event Committee</h3>
<p>Events this size need year-round support - securing a site, sorting out contracts and choosing an Event Steward needs to happen early, and it takes a team of behind-the-scenes players to stay on top of things. If you'd like to be a part of the Ormþing Event committee, contact the <a href="mailto:seneschal@insulaedraconis.org">Principality Seneschal</a>.</p>

<p>The committee, together with the Seneschal, will review bids up to nearly a year in advance. If you and your group are interested in putting a bid together, get in touch with the Seneschal and take a look at <a href="https://insulaedraconis.org/library/group-resources/bidding-for-events/">Bidding for Principality Events</a> to get an idea of what you'll need to think about. It's important to have the bid accepted and the Event Steward in place well in advance, so they have time to build a team and begin advertising.</p> 

<h3>Volunteering</h3>
<p>Volunteers of all sorts are what make any event run. You could offer to assist with site preparation, setting up pavilions and other structures, or coordinating logistics such as food, drinks, and supplies. You might also have the opportunity to help plan and organize the various activities and events that will take place during the event, such as combat tournaments, archery contests, and medieval craft demonstrations.</p>

<p>In addition to the hands-on work, you will also have the chance to interact with participants and help create a welcoming and inclusive environment. Whether you are helping to promote the event through marketing and outreach, or simply engaging with participants and answering their questions, you will play a vital role in creating a truly unforgettable experience.</p>

<p>At the end of each day, you can feel a deep sense of pride and accomplishment, knowing that you have helped bring a piece of history to life. If you'd like to volunteer at the event, get in touch with the <a href="mailto:id-summer-event-steward@insulaedraconis.org">Event Steward</a></p>
