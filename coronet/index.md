  <h3>From Her Highness</h3>
  <p>I am a little hard of hearing. Thanks for your patience as I lean in and say, “I’m sorry, would you please say that again?”</p>
  <p>I also have a chronic health issue that sometimes impacts my ability to participate 100%. Again, thanks for your patience.</p>

  <h2>About the Coronets</h2>

  <p>The Coronets of Insulae Draconis (Princes, Princesses, or equal titles from other languages) represent the Crown of Drachenwald in the Principality. As such, they should be treated as any other royal couple in the Kingdom. In essence, be courteous and respectful of what they are representing and of the fact that their time often is not their own. Much of each event they attend will be spent officiating, being in meetings, or just listening to people's opinions. Read more about how to <a href="{% link coronet/behaviour-around-royal-couple.md %}">behave around the Coronets</a> including at Court.</p>

  <p>The Coronets will hold Court at most events at which they are in attendance. They may have announcements for public business but they also are responsible for bestowing Awards on members where the people of Insulae Draconis have recommended that a member should be so honoured. Insulae Draconis has many ways to reward people for hard work, skill and courtesy. You can <a href="{% link activities/heraldry/awards.md %}">read more about awards</a>, <a href="http://op.drachenwald.sca.org/"> check whether someone already has an award</a> and then <a href="{% link coronet/recommend.html %}">make an award recommendation</a></p>
