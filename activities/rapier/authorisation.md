Authorisation is the test you must pass with a marshal before engaging in combat. It is not an assessment of your skill but a test to make sure you know the rules as laid down by the kingdom, that you know how to protect yourself in combat situations and you are basically competent with your equipment. You should [Download the Drachenwald fencing Rulebook](https://drachenwald.sca.org/offices/fencing-marshal/) and familiarise yourself with it. If you intend to travel to other kingdoms to fence, you may also want to have some [knowledge of the Society rules](https://www.sca.org/resources/martial-activities/).
